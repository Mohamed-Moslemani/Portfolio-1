    <h1>Stuck in Mediocrity</h1>
    <h4><i> In the 21th century, the greatest price to pay is that of being mediocre.</i> </h4>
    <p>What is mediocrity? Take this painting as an example:
Two mountains and a sun between them, with green colors. It’s a drawing we all did at some point, it’s average, it doesn’t break loose of the common, and it remains captured in the middle, un-categorized as negative or positive, a zero.
A mediocre is a herd, a follower of the alpha, it cannot lead, it cannot jump off the followed road, it cannot create, and hence, it remains enslaved by the what the community decides to be average. It’s no longer a three parts social stratification, it got reduced by the power of the media into two: The leaders and the herd.
The question of leadership and its seduction interests many, and as I usually do, I relate it to evolution. Being the leader of the pack as an early human meant you get to enjoy more sexual intercourses, abundant food, and warmth. Our current communities didn’t make a leap over this, as a leader remains with huge advantages over the followers.</p>

    <p> The switch of social media created a bubble around fame and money, prioritizing both and assigning them as major traits of a successful leader.
The leadership babble (check https://www.psypost.org/2021/07/new-study-finds-people-who-speak-more-are-more-likely-to-be-viewed-as-leaders-61540) is also a great evidence reassuring that our community standards shifted as social media grew thicker.</p>
<p>People currently refer to mediocrity as a 9-5 job, a car, a house, and a love life. What was considered a luxury nearly 100 years ago (a car), is now considered mediocre.
The evolution of our societies declare such stage as a necessity, a time where luxury shifts to normality, and a higher luxury arise, this is no news.
But referring to mediocrity as being stuck at it, surely is.
Why? As we mentioned, leadership is seductive, it’s there in our genes, and we can’t deny it. A journey lead by hormonal and genetical influences, such an irony is the human race.</p>

<p>The fear of mediocrity grew significantly in Gen Z, remarkably most of them switching to online business, crypto-currencies, and social media platforms working, all three considered a relatively easy way to reach fame and money, two main components of a leader, with ability to affect the crowd easily. Seductive, right?</p>
<p>Is mediocrity an obstacle against the evolution of our societies? Is it a failure to be mediocre? To not reach the lights of the world?
Physicists and science popularizers are a pretty good example on such a case.
Researchers around the world working what is considered a “mediocre” job with relatively low income compared to other jobs, when science popularizers “babble” around with words to lead the race of science.
All undergraduates know Neil Degrasse Tyson, but the real researchers who went in depth with working and spending years on a theory, to be represented in a show by Tyson, giving him a revenue of a few millions.</p>
<p>Don’t get me wrong, I got no issue with Neil, but mediocrity took a shift as such group of people grew over the shoulders of mediocre ones.
Mediocrity isn’t being a background, or an outcast, it’s being the content creator, the builder of the stage, I love mediocrity, and frankly, I embrace it.
I currently embrace being out of the light, free of worry, free of social stress, that’s a healthy environment for a young enthusiast to flourish.
We all heard of breakdowns of huge brains under the lens, mediocrity offers freedom, and nothing feels like freedom.</p>
<p>I’m stuck in mediocrity, and I like it that way, having a normal life was never below normal, it’s just being part of the network, enjoying earth, enjoying civilization, and building some of its pride, a pride to be forgotten with time, after all, nothing grows out of time.

    <h1>On the Absurdity of Life</h1>

    <p>As days pass and we slip into a hypnotic routine where mediocrity dominates, it becomes natural to lose interest in life and to question meaning. After all, among more than seven billion people, who am I to have a life worth living, one that carries meaning?</p>

    <p>The loss of self is a heavy price to pay. How cruel it is to lose the soul through the narrow passages of daily life. What am I going to do? That question becomes the first social pressure, followed by many others.</p>

    <p>We tend to get lost in life. As failure preys on our attempts, fear grows. Perhaps it is the fear of living, or the fear of dying without ever having lived.</p>

    <h2>Why Does Living Matter?</h2>

    <p>Why does it matter to live, to achieve, to climb mountains of success and observe those beneath us, labeled as failures? This drive appears biological, a push toward dominance within small societies.</p>

    <p>Some accuse this view of materialism, reducing life to biological, chemical, and physical processes. But beyond the aesthetic layer, is life not driven by these reactions?</p>

    <h2>Meaning Through the Eyes of Others</h2>

    <p>The meaning of life has been examined by many thinkers, notably Sigmund Freud and Viktor Frankl, whose conclusions sharply diverge.</p>

    <p>Another perspective appears in <em>The Happiness Hypothesis</em> by Jonathan Haidt, where happiness is reduced to an equation balancing material and aesthetic factors. This approach collapses under the argument to moderation fallacy. Life is rarely balanced. It is often extreme, uneven, and contradictory.</p>

    <p>Perhaps life is this or that. Rarely moderation. That realization pushed me to confront thoughts accumulated over the past months.</p>

    <h2>Camus, Frankl, and Contradiction</h2>

    <p>In <em>The Myth of Sisyphus</em>, Albert Camus suggests that suicide emerges from the search for meaning, a claim that feels contradictory. How does finding meaning lead to abandoning life?</p>

    <p>Frankl offers a different view: when people cannot find meaning, they distract themselves with pleasure.</p>

    <p>At first, these views seem unrelated. But perhaps they converge. Excessive pleasure erodes meaning. Loss of meaning leads to suicide. Yet Camus suggests that finding meaning may also lead there. The contradiction remains unresolved, and I still struggle to grasp its depth.</p>

    <h2>Meaning, Joy, and Indifference</h2>

    <p>What does it mean to find meaning? Passion? Dreams? Goals? Life often degrades into daily struggles where we question whether it is all worth it.</p>

    <p>These struggles are interrupted by moments of genuine happiness, brief sparks of joy during which questions of meaning disappear. Does joy lead to meaning? I do not know, and frankly, I do not care.</p>

    <p>I refuse to waste my days interrogating the meaning of life while time keeps moving. Questioning meaning often strips life of it. I envy those who never asked, those free from such consuming thoughts.</p>

    <h2>Closing Thoughts</h2>

    <p>Thank you, Albert Camus. May you rest in peace for the work you left behind, written by a man who claimed he did not want to waste his life searching for meaning.</p>

    <p>When physics becomes overwhelming, I turn to philosophy. Not because physics is scary, but because it demands too much certainty. Perhaps my meaning lies in discovering what is out there. And if there is nothing, then my meaning may be built on nothing.</p>

    <p>Does that make my life meaningless? I do not know. I hope not.</p>

 <p> As days progress, and as we enter a hypnotic state of mind, where mediocrity rules over us, it’s totally expected to lose interest in life, and to question meaning. After all. of all the 7+ billion people, who am I to have a life worth living, one with meaning?
The loss of self is one of a great price to pay, and how cruel it is to lose the soul through the narrow passages of life?
What am I going to do? That’s the first question, or perhaps the first social stress, of many.
‘We tend to get lost in life, and as failure preys on our trials, fear grows, perhaps it’s a fear of living, or maybe, a fear of dying without living.</p>
<p>Why does it matter to live? To achieve? To climb the mountains of success and observe those beneath us? The ones that failed life.
A biological instinct, leading us to become the alpha male of our small societies. Some may accuse me of materialism, stating that I capture the meaning of life and squeeze it onto a bottle of biological, chemical, and physical phenomena. but apart from the aesthetic part of life, isn’t it but a bunch of reactions lead by these three phenomena?</p>
<p>The meaning of life is an issue tackled by many of the greats, ranging between Freud and Victor Frankl mainly, both of which had nearly opposite thoughts.
The stand taken by many, and which I noticed existing in “The happiness hypothesis” (the latter is a book by Jonathan Heidt), in which he relates internal joy to an equation of four terms, ranging between materialistic and aesthetic objects.
This approach taken by Heidt is falsified by Argument to moderation fallacy, and I moderately plea to all writers not to fall for such fallacies.
I admire that, but perhaps life is this or that, it’s no near moderation, and thus, I feel the need to expose some of the thoughts I’ve been piling up through the past few months.</p>
<p>In his book, “The Myth of Sisyphus”, Albert Camus implies that suicide could be an act reasoned behind finding the meaning of life, and that is contradictory. In what sense is finding the meaning of life, leads to one leaving it?
On the other hand, Victor Frankl, who we mentioned earlier, as I quote: “When a person can’t find a deep sense of meaning, they distract themselves with pleasure.”</p>
<p> One might question any relation between the two, and that’s expected, however, here, I think we can extend Frankl’s thoughts to reach the absurdity of suicide mentioned by Camus. Excessive pleasure leads to loss of meaning, and loss of meaning leads to suicide. On the contrary, finding meaning leads to suicide.
I still take my time in trying to understand Camus’s thoughts, of their depth as they contradict a basic logic.</p>
<p>We spoke of meaning, but what is finding meaning? Is it passion? dreams? goals?
life tends to turn into a bunch of daily troubles at which we question whether they’re worth it (it referring to life oddly).
These daily troubles are occupied by moments of sincere happiness, a stimulating joy passing for a few moments, at which we forget our questions of meaning, in that, is finding joy a road to finding meaning?
I don’t know, and frankly, I don’t care.
I wouldn’t want to waste my days questioning the real meaning of my life, while day progress. After all, questioning meaning leads to more loss of meaning, and hence, I envy those who never questioned it, those who are free of such occupying thoughts.</p>
<p>Thank you, Albert Camus, and may you rest in peace, for such piece of art you left behind you, a book worth all the time given to it, coming from the man who said that he didn’t want to waste his time on the meaning of life.

</p>
<p>It’s a good habit I developed to switch to philosophy whenever physics is too much, or too scary. Okay, scary is not the word, I think the word is, whenever physics is acting tough on me, but after all, I think that my meaning of life lies in finding what is out there, perhaps there’s nothing out there, and hence, my meaning of life is based on nothing, in that, is my life meaningless? I don’t know, but I hope not!</p>

  excerpt: "A critique of the obsession with theoretical physics, its cultural hype, and the growing gap between abstraction and reality.",
  cover: "/blog/theory.jpg",
  content: ` 
  <h3>Why This Again?</h3>
  <p>When one think of all the possibilities he has in physics, it’s typical to look at theoretical physics as the land of dreams, the higher aim, the Einsteinian mystery, and typically, it’s what each undergraduate student thinks to himself as he’s progressing through the years.
But as in life, diversity is a must, and physics wouldn’t progress without all the experimentalists who are investing their daily time in building up a better equipment and experiments, and through these, proving the existence of “mathematical entities”.</p>
<p>Through the past 100 years, and with the build up of the quantum theory, along with string theory, quantum loop, and other “catchy” phrases, theoretical physics became the main land for all students. As for experimental, it sounded boring and repeatable. Catchy phrases aren’t the only one to blame, there’s science popularizers and society.</p>
<p>When Brian Greene, Hawking, and other physicists/popularizers began their journey in spreading science, we all thought of this as the next new step, and it sounded ideal to have certain figures giving directions and leading little kids through the bumpy roads of physics. But it’s not all cherries and honey, for as time progressed, we found ourselves stuck with concepts that are misused even by the very greats, and physics was soon to become prone to fallacies.</p>
<p>I don’t hold a grudge against popularizers, in fact, I like many of them, read some books and watched some videos, but the problem again arises with the excessiveness of this content, and the way it builds up through the mind of young generations. When the first thing we hear off an undergraduate student is the multiverse, we need to surely change our methods.</p>
<p>So, when you ask why this again, I say you should go talk with the people in departments, and stick to students, hear the fallacies, the expectations, and in turn, acknowledge them of what it’s really like, and what’s best for them and for the field.
Now, I’m not attacking theoretical physics as a field (hopefully), in fact, I find it interesting, and worth investing my time in the future at, but in turn, the hype is pushing me away, much like it did off anything.</p>

<h3>Expectations Vs Reality</h3>
<p>What a 12 years old kid would see when he first hooks up to science, is weird people with clumsy hair writing weird formulas on a green board, and he’d think to himself: “I like that”.</p>
<p>But progressing through the field, and with the accumulation of knowledge, he comes to see it as deeper than what it is.
Personally, as I am progressing through physics, my fear of theoretical grows one day at a time, and I believe each one should. It’s not a “pass me” field, and you’re prone to failure, actually, your career is.
Moreover, theoretical physics is academia work, which has a lot of cons on many sides. To begin, the burnout of academia between research and classes, which is met by a relatively low income.</p>
<p>I won’t depend in my argument on the income rate, because as a science person, I think of income as a second base, my main base is surely to contribute through the success of this field, and here goes my second argument.
Lately, as many of us are witnessing, theorists hit rock bottom (for more info check “where a theorist loses it”). The developments of various field of abstract physics is set to a stoppage, with many theories fighting to be the king of the hill in this war of the god equation.
Our understanding of the quantum world didn’t develop as much since it was first introduced, and the foundations of quantum mechanics are “the lands of the lost”. Also, particle physicists hit another rock bottom with the excessive particles suggested, associating a one with each and every unknown data.</p>
<p>When we introduce theoretical physics, we usually speak of abstract mathematics, something I truly love, but the way it’s interpreted and applied to a system, is where the word physics comes into play. Lately however, many theories became a winning mathematical ground, but non-efficient as a physical interpretation. As a mini-physicist, I find it hard to accept a purely mathematical model not backed up with experimental data, and take it for granted. Honestly, I find such model useless in my field. What is a model that doesn’t represent reality, or at least speculates about it.
We tend to value math, and that’s understandable, it’s the alphabet of the universe. But if the alphabets aren’t arranged in a certain order, we won’t be able to understand anything around us.</p>
<p>The only theoretical positivity I can sense is that of low funding necessity, which is then met with huge funding necessity in case of an experimental proof, but that’s the experimentalists problem right?</p>

<h3>The Community</h3>
<p>Any community is helpful, whether scientific, or not. It helps you to build diversity in your thoughts, with the range of accepting what you feel is reasonable.
In physics however, we’re recently encountered with religion-like belief systems, protected by “sacred” researchers, and kept intact , nearly similar to holy books.
Researchers take their theories as absolutes, the only way to go, refusing to compensate, and rearrange their ideas for the field’s good.</p>
<p>It’s a physicist dream to create the theory of wonder, the summary of our universe, and while I see it as a long catch, and also purely aesthetic, it remains the goal of many. Theories are currently built to fit this standard, the god equation standard (Michio Kaku’s phrase, not mine).</p>
<p>Apart from that, I sense (and God I hope I’m wrong) a toxicity in the whole physics community. The overloading stress put on one’s self, and the burnout each physicist faces, along with a huge social pressure, all contribute into making the theoretical field, a land of mines.</p>

<h3>Less Talking, More Working</h3>
<p>We speak math, create these beautiful concepts, arrange them in ways to lead humanity into a better future, a scientific one.
Theoretical physics had its own trendline, it helped in developing important technologies, and is yet to be helping with the next generation quantum computing.
The problem was never the field itself, it’s how the public perceives it.</p>
<p>It’s also a problem to see fallacies spread through the community, and to not acknowledge the right approach for one’s self and for the field’s best.
Whether the current theoretical developments surrounding blackholes and quantum gravity have any applications to our real world, or would yield out some good technologies, is a question. Whether all of these approaches are aesthetic, and won’t help us a bit in building up a better world is also another question.</p>
<p>However, recent developments (as mentioned) are being less aesthetic, and I think it’s fair to say that it’s time for physicists to move on, and stop trying to answer the unanswered.
We are scientists, interested in understanding the laws of the universe, how it works, perhaps. But also, we have a responsibility towards our own society, to make it better, and lead it to safer shores.</p>
<p>This blog was kind of random, but nevertheless, I had these thoughts for a valid interval of time. Perhaps it’s fear of the next step, the stress surrounding the physics fields, the uncertainty of theoretical physics (Heisenberg intensifies).
I think that we all should be terrified of physics, and in fact, I think this fear pushes me deeper.</p>
<p>Maybe this blog is but a subconscious defensive mechanism by me, to put obstacles and to be pushed away from what’s perceived as dangerous. But to be honest, I like this fear, and I don’t mind going in depth through it, as long as I see development on the tunnel’s end.</p>

  <p>We all had similar incidents, sometimes within ourselves, where we believed or worked through an idea, that we came to realize how wrong it was.
With the constant increase of human population, reaching current levels of 7 billion, it’s typical to see a wide variety of opinions in all sort of fields, even over a 1 + 1.
Variety, or freedom, call it as you please, is a main principle of our lives, if inexistent, we feel constraint and limited. But should freedom, be free? In that I mean, how much freedom is enough?</p>
<p>A flashback to the twentieth century shows us that humans could do horrible things when given absolute freedom, while giving excuses to all acts. For instance, in the WWII, Adolf Hitler, the Führer of the Deutsch army, went in this parade of death and war, while imagining himself as the savior of mankind. He aimed to create the perfect world by all means, and many of his followers viewed him as the “Christ of the bible”, and while the precise number of his followers is unknown, the precise number of the people he killed in the name of perfection isn’t.
</p>
<p>Along the WWII, our communicational systems developed, and nearly 70 years later, we are in the middle of the 21th century, a connected era, where info is found freely, with millions of sources, and millions of books. Information is no longer bound to schools or universities, and it’s no longer a scarce piece, it’s available now through crash courses found on all sites, and through papers that can be downloaded easily and freely. Considering this increase in the ability of reaching reliable info, one might expect the decrease of biased concepts among human beings, and the increase of scientific-based thinking. However, things flowed oppositely.
</p>
<p>The wide spread of info caused the creation of different of different opinions and thoughts by separate groups. This is commonly observed in all fields. In theology for example, we come to see that each religion is now separated to sub-religions, and each sub-religion has a different leader that flows in the river of the main religion. Same goes for my field, physics, where you come to see opposing theories, each supported by a group of physicists, working day and night in order to prove the theory (e.g: string theory and quantum loop theory).
</p>
<p><i>But what is bias? What does it feel to be biased? How can one tell that he’s biased?</i></p>

<h3>definition and examples:</h3>
<p>Bias, in its very definition, is a representation of inclination towards a certain idea or belief. It’s a subconscious tendency towards the belief, caused by your subjective view of life around you.</p>
<p>Sometimes it can be self-centered (much like Hitler’s case). Other times, it is outward, to a certain idea that you might’ve encountered through your childhood, and it made its way through your subconscious. But what does that have to do with our intro considering info? Well, to begin, with the increase of info supply, you’re often reaching a constant supply of a certain idea. For instance, I started my journey in physics with a documentary by Brian Greene considering the quantum world. While the documentary was my hook to this field, it supplied me with an aesthetic figure of the quantum world, and planted many “false” concepts that I’ve worked a lot in order to get rid of.</p>
<p>This huge supply I had when I was quite young and inexperienced in this field (I still am) was a main bias to me, as it clinged md to quantumy stuff, up until now, and while I’m happy aith that, I hate the way it began. Living in Lebanon, a country with -God knows how many- parties was tough as well. You are a 10 year old with all these un-understandable words around you, and there you are trying to make sense of it, and the next thing you know is that you’re a teenager blindfolded by a certain leader or party.</p>
<p>This bias is often observed, and I still observe it in other people. It’s quite hard to get rid of such planted idea, it’s like reprogramming your whole childhood as an adult.</p>
<p>Apart from this, my favorite example of bias is a show called kitchen nightmares, hosted by Gordon Ramsay, a great chef. In one of the episodes, Gordon visits a pizza shop, in which the owner thinks he’s serving the best pizza in town, but when confronted by Gordon, he started giving ridiculious excuses, and his attitude shifted into this defensive behavior. He, the owner, was biased heavily by himself into thinking that his pizza was the best, yet, when confronted by reality, he rejected it, because he felt it was a danger to his existence. That’s what bias feels like, and while you might think that such example cannot resemble what a deep idea like bias is, I do think it’s actually the best example. Am I biased of thinking so? I don’t know.</p>
<p>Religious Bias, on the other hand, usually causes an “existential crisis” for the individual if countered. I’ve witnessed many religious debates, whether it’s the famous videos of the late Richard Dawkins, or even a personal debate with friends/family. I observed a lot of interesting behavior in these debates, but mainly, the unconditional defense of these people for their beliefs, and as you go deeper in proving your view, the opposing person grows aggressive in defending his view. It’s like you’re threating his own identity and in fact, you are.
</p>
<p>I’m usually amazed by the coping mechanism followed by individuals in order to accept the loop holes present in their biased view of any idea or belief. I would reside from using religious examples, but after all, they’re a great resemblance. For instance, followers of religion X tend to ignore the false verses of Book X in order to justify or defend their religion, and once confronted with these loop holes, they start justifying such verse by obsolete methods. I’m not pointing fingers on any religion here, and to be honest, I’m more intrigued by ”false science followers”, who held atheism as the religion of science (Refer to God on trial for more details). The fact that Richard Dawkins, a great proponent of atheism and ”science”, still uses logical fallacies in many of his discussions, tells one a lot about his biased view. I would love to have a valid discussion with Richard one day, I wonder what he has to answer about many of my questions.</p>

<h3>Bias: The origin of wars</h3>
<p>In an earlier blog I wrote called “Between absoluteness and relativism: goodness and evil”, I mentioned a series of actions done through human history, that usually lead to wars.</p>
<pAll this series is governed by a main catalyst, that is, bias. If an individual doesn’t happen to develop a biased view, he won’t develop a subjective fanaticism that’ll eventually lead to his unconditional defense.</p>
<p>Hitler is an interesting psychological subject. Reading about his early life, he was subject to an abusive dad, the death of a young brother, and later, the death of a mother. That surely contributed to his wild behavior. Hitler’s dad was an Austrian public official, and given his hard and tough relationship with his son Adolf, we can observe why the latter was a fanatic Deutsch nationalist, a behavior that was observed in his early life at school. I would like to see how Hitler’s life could’ve gone if his dad wasn’t that much abusive. I’d also like to point out that I’m surely not giving excuses to probably the greatest dictator in the last century, so just to remain on the safe side.
</p>
<p>What one man calls wrong, the other calls right, and they both go in this journey of defending something that is both right and wrong (I’m trying to resist not mentioning the concept of a superposition so take that into account, a physics-free blog).</p>
<p>Wars form a major part of human history, and they’re surely an integral part of our development, but we had a very costly price to pay.
Religious differences, ethical ones, races, and many more, are all a proof on our diversity. The word diversity has the ability to summarize our history, and the word bias has the ability to explain it.</p>
<p>Apart from these words, is a biased view really that dangerous? Is it, that bias, could’ve accounted for our existence and evolution, in a certain way, we still haven’t seen? I mean, how would our world be, without bias?</p>

<h3>Unbiased: Non-existent</h3>
<p>Bias is the leader of many of our actions, and stimuli of many of incidents through the history of time. It plays a role, way deeper than what we actually and usually observe, a sub-conscious role, that is, an implicit bias.
I hardly think humans would’ve survived without bias. Think of the next series for a moment:</p>
<p>You observe an individual –> you think he’s wrong –> you proceed to spread your view of what is right –> communicative behavior –> exchange of thoughts –> development of thoughts –> …et cetera</p>
<p>Now, imagine the absence of bias, and the second step is initially removed, thus, you’ll have no development of whatsoever.
</p>
<p>I mean even now in science, bias exists, and it’s a major game-changer in the development of technologies and theories.
Even deeper, bias is the origin of diversity. If no bias exists, what would make us different? what would make us think out of our box, and into another box, in order to reach a better result?
</p>
<p>In short, the way I see it, bias is a necessity in order to develop into a better person individually, and a better race globally.
In fact, you cannot be un-biased. You are, you just don’t know it. But I do, I know that you’re biased, and I know that I am.</p>

<h3>I’m biased, and I know it:</h3>
<p>The other day I was confronted of my inclination into a certain idea, of which I didn’t observe as an inclination, probably because of how biased I am into myself. This was actually my main motive behind this blog. I wanted to address to people how bias is actually controlling their whole life, and how being subjected by a certain type of info for a certain time interval, can actually change the way you view things effectively.</p>
<p>Read any book, and observe how your ideas shape to revolve around that book. It’s bias.</p>
<p>Apart from this, logical fallacies and their usage stems from extreme bias also, existing as self-excuses in order to create the illusion of a logical idea, when it’s not.
But how can we heal from biases? How can we know that we’re not biased?</p>
<p>Lately, I came to the conclusion that, as a scientist, you can never reach certainty, or a definite answer. There’s always going to be a modification, and that’s why, we should always seek to not believe our inner gut, or what our mind tells us, and only trust the actual results observed in credible and objective manner.</p>
<p>I think the ultimate test of bias is to try and engage in opposing theories, and observe how you develop your argument as opposed to the counter idea. If you start using fallacies to explain your idea, chances are, you’re biased. The more you reside to critical thinking and logic, the more likely you’re becoming un-biased. But I think that it’s fair enough to say that you’ll never be completely free from bias, because you need it at certain incidents.</p>
<h3>Personal bias, observed biases, and more:</h3>
<p>I cannot be biased, I mean, I think logically of every aspect of life, and I implement my crticial thinking into it all. But wait, what if I’m biaded into thinking so? Well, guess we’ll never know. However, I know how many people are biased, and how they try to hide this bias, but how it’ll probably fail them, and it’ll be observed clearly. So if you’re biased, that’s okay, all people are.</p>
<p>I believe that spotting a self bias requires such an impressive cognitive ability, and progressing through that is pretty tough. It requires flexibility, and many other skills. It’s not easy to accept that you’re biased, and that what you believed for the past few years might be a bunch of “un-recycled matter”.</p>
<p>As a personal experience, I think my main bias remains circulating around religion. Growing up in a religiohs house, and vibrating towards science quite early, didn’t go well for me. You feel separated between two identites, fluctuating between this and that, you’re afraid of letting go of your spiritual self, because it identifies the old you, and you’re afraid of giving up the scientific crticial part, which identifies who you are now, and plays a major role in your future self. This actually helped me in developing this flexibility, and I consider myself quite able to accept and evaluate other ideas regardless of their importance to me. But, for all we know, maybe I’m biased into thinking that I’m quite flexible, and all I’m living on is a lie. So if you know who you are, or how good you are, I got bad news for you: you’re probably biased, and I know it.</p>
