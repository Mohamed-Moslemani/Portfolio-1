  content: `-
   <p> In the summer of some year, around a time which none have heard of, and in the amidst of unrecognizable patterns, you existed. There, you stood, observing nothingness that filled space-time around you, a full nothingness, spoiling the peace of a far-away stream.
Clarity reached you, and you questioned reality as it showed up naked, in its truest form. What is reality? you screamed. Where do I stand, as earth around me falls? What is the meaning behind it all? </p>
<p>Clarity is like a switch, but once turned on, it cannot be turned off, and once you question the meaning of it, the meaning of 128 chemical compounds creating the so called observable universe, you lose yourself in a stream of thoughts, leading to absolute drowning.</p>
<p>We are all drowning, some in the filthy swamps of their ideologies, others in their own creativity, and so you question of the worthiness of drowning in a stream of questions, and whether it’ll lead to reality.
</p>
<p>Reality is often disappointing though, and life, is often meaningless in a meaningful way, that the very thing that grants it meaning, steals it away. We spend a lifetime searching for meaning, ignoring the fact that trying to reach such meaning, makes life meaningless, that the quest of meaning is meaningless, because meaning doesn’t exist. The paradox of meaning, is that for a meaning to exist, we shall surrender for the idea of existence of a God to grant earth that absolute meaning, and in surrendering towards the idea of a God, we assure that this meaning is not ours, but to a greater deity (supposedly existing).
</p>
<p>The stream of meaning leads to the caves of darkness, of losing one’s interest in this blue dot, and in knowing that this life is ordered by chaos, and that all of our pain, sorrow, happiness, and absurd, is inevitably fading away. Knowing that absurdity rules our 80 years of growth, and that there are no exits. We are surrounded by darkness of thoughts, and the our biggest survival strategy, is blinding ourselves.
</p>
<p>To not see the absurd, is to deny its existence, and to grant meaning to life, is to deny its reality.</p>
<p>My quest of meaning ends here, with this short blog, for it’s too consuming, too hard for me to handle, that it’s not worth the trouble, and that in the long run, life itself is not worth the trouble, that we are a cosmic dust, ruled by absolute chaos, searching for a thing in nothing, a blinded civilization, streaming into its own destiny, and until then, you’ll be here, in a stream, with a blindfold, protecting you from the absurd, inside of you.

  excerpt: "In the 21th century, the greatest price to pay is that of being mediocre.",
  cover: "/blog/mediocrity.jpg",
  content: `<p>What is mediocrity? Take this painting as an example:</p>
  <p>Two mountains and a sun between them, with green colors. It’s a drawing we all did at some point, it’s average, it doesn’t break loose of the common, and it remains captured in the middle, un-categorized as negative or positive, a zero.
</p>
<p>A mediocre is a herd, a follower of the alpha, it cannot lead, it cannot jump off the followed road, it cannot create, and hence, it remains enslaved by the what the community decides to be average. It’s no longer a three parts social stratification, it got reduced by the power of the media into two: The leaders and the herd.
</p>
<p>The question of leadership and its seduction interests many, and as I usually do, I relate it to evolution. Being the leader of the pack as an early human meant you get to enjoy more sexual intercourses, abundant food, and warmth. Our current communities didn’t make a leap over this, as a leader remains with huge advantages over the followers.
</p>
<p>The switch of social media created a bubble around fame and money, prioritizing both and assigning them as major traits of a successful leader.
</p>
<p>The leadership babble (check https://www.psypost.org/2021/07/new-study-finds-people-who-speak-more-are-more-likely-to-be-viewed-as-leaders-61540) is also a great evidence reassuring that our community standards shifted as social media grew thicker.
</p>
<p>People currently refer to mediocrity as a 9-5 job, a car, a house, and a love life. What was considered a luxury nearly 100 years ago (a car), is now considered mediocre.
The evolution of our societies declare such stage as a necessity, a time where luxury shifts to normality, and a higher luxury arise, this is no news.</p>
<p>But referring to mediocrity as being stuck at it, surely is.
</p>
<p>Why? As we mentioned, leadership is seductive, it’s there in our genes, and we can’t deny it. A journey lead by hormonal and genetical influences, such an irony is the human race.
</p>
<p>The fear of mediocrity grew significantly in Gen Z, remarkably most of them switching to online business, crypto-currencies, and social media platforms working, all three considered a relatively easy way to reach fame and money, two main components of a leader, with ability to affect the crowd easily. Seductive, right?
</p>
<p>Is mediocrity an obstacle against the evolution of our societies? Is it a failure to be mediocre? To not reach the lights of the world?
</p>
<p>Physicists and science popularizers are a pretty good example on such a case.
Researchers around the world working what is considered a “mediocre” job with relatively low income compared to other jobs, when science popularizers “babble” around with words to lead the race of science.</p>
<p>All undergraduates know Neil Degrasse Tyson, but the real researchers who went in depth with working and spending years on a theory, to be represented in a show by Tyson, giving him a revenue of a few millions.
</p>
<p>Don’t get me wrong, I got no issue with Neil, but mediocrity took a shift as such group of people grew over the shoulders of mediocre ones.
</p>
<p>Mediocrity isn’t being a background, or an outcast, it’s being the content creator, the builder of the stage, I love mediocrity, and frankly, I embrace it.
</p>
<p>I currently embrace being out of the light, free of worry, free of social stress, that’s a healthy environment for a young enthusiast to flourish.
</p>
<p>We all heard of breakdowns of huge brains under the lens, mediocrity offers freedom, and nothing feels like freedom.
</p>
<p>I’m stuck in mediocrity, and I like it that way, having a normal life was never below normal, it’s just being part of the network, enjoying earth, enjoying civilization, and building some of its pride, a pride to be forgotten with time, after all, nothing grows out of time.

  excerpt: "A critique of the obsession with theoretical physics, its cultural hype, and the growing gap between abstraction and reality.",
  cover: "/blog/theory.jpg",
  content: ` 
  <h3>Why This Again?</h3>
  <p>When one think of all the possibilities he has in physics, it’s typical to look at theoretical physics as the land of dreams, the higher aim, the Einsteinian mystery, and typically, it’s what each undergraduate student thinks to himself as he’s progressing through the years.
But as in life, diversity is a must, and physics wouldn’t progress without all the experimentalists who are investing their daily time in building up a better equipment and experiments, and through these, proving the existence of “mathematical entities”.</p>
<p>Through the past 100 years, and with the build up of the quantum theory, along with string theory, quantum loop, and other “catchy” phrases, theoretical physics became the main land for all students. As for experimental, it sounded boring and repeatable. Catchy phrases aren’t the only one to blame, there’s science popularizers and society.</p>
<p>When Brian Greene, Hawking, and other physicists/popularizers began their journey in spreading science, we all thought of this as the next new step, and it sounded ideal to have certain figures giving directions and leading little kids through the bumpy roads of physics. But it’s not all cherries and honey, for as time progressed, we found ourselves stuck with concepts that are misused even by the very greats, and physics was soon to become prone to fallacies.</p>
<p>I don’t hold a grudge against popularizers, in fact, I like many of them, read some books and watched some videos, but the problem again arises with the excessiveness of this content, and the way it builds up through the mind of young generations. When the first thing we hear off an undergraduate student is the multiverse, we need to surely change our methods.</p>
<p>So, when you ask why this again, I say you should go talk with the people in departments, and stick to students, hear the fallacies, the expectations, and in turn, acknowledge them of what it’s really like, and what’s best for them and for the field.
Now, I’m not attacking theoretical physics as a field (hopefully), in fact, I find it interesting, and worth investing my time in the future at, but in turn, the hype is pushing me away, much like it did off anything.</p>

<h3>Expectations Vs Reality</h3>
<p>What a 12 years old kid would see when he first hooks up to science, is weird people with clumsy hair writing weird formulas on a green board, and he’d think to himself: “I like that”.</p>
<p>But progressing through the field, and with the accumulation of knowledge, he comes to see it as deeper than what it is.
Personally, as I am progressing through physics, my fear of theoretical grows one day at a time, and I believe each one should. It’s not a “pass me” field, and you’re prone to failure, actually, your career is.
Moreover, theoretical physics is academia work, which has a lot of cons on many sides. To begin, the burnout of academia between research and classes, which is met by a relatively low income.</p>
<p>I won’t depend in my argument on the income rate, because as a science person, I think of income as a second base, my main base is surely to contribute through the success of this field, and here goes my second argument.
Lately, as many of us are witnessing, theorists hit rock bottom (for more info check “where a theorist loses it”). The developments of various field of abstract physics is set to a stoppage, with many theories fighting to be the king of the hill in this war of the god equation.
Our understanding of the quantum world didn’t develop as much since it was first introduced, and the foundations of quantum mechanics are “the lands of the lost”. Also, particle physicists hit another rock bottom with the excessive particles suggested, associating a one with each and every unknown data.</p>
<p>When we introduce theoretical physics, we usually speak of abstract mathematics, something I truly love, but the way it’s interpreted and applied to a system, is where the word physics comes into play. Lately however, many theories became a winning mathematical ground, but non-efficient as a physical interpretation. As a mini-physicist, I find it hard to accept a purely mathematical model not backed up with experimental data, and take it for granted. Honestly, I find such model useless in my field. What is a model that doesn’t represent reality, or at least speculates about it.
We tend to value math, and that’s understandable, it’s the alphabet of the universe. But if the alphabets aren’t arranged in a certain order, we won’t be able to understand anything around us.</p>
<p>The only theoretical positivity I can sense is that of low funding necessity, which is then met with huge funding necessity in case of an experimental proof, but that’s the experimentalists problem right?</p>

<h3>The Community</h3>
<p>Any community is helpful, whether scientific, or not. It helps you to build diversity in your thoughts, with the range of accepting what you feel is reasonable.
In physics however, we’re recently encountered with religion-like belief systems, protected by “sacred” researchers, and kept intact , nearly similar to holy books.
Researchers take their theories as absolutes, the only way to go, refusing to compensate, and rearrange their ideas for the field’s good.</p>
<p>It’s a physicist dream to create the theory of wonder, the summary of our universe, and while I see it as a long catch, and also purely aesthetic, it remains the goal of many. Theories are currently built to fit this standard, the god equation standard (Michio Kaku’s phrase, not mine).</p>
<p>Apart from that, I sense (and God I hope I’m wrong) a toxicity in the whole physics community. The overloading stress put on one’s self, and the burnout each physicist faces, along with a huge social pressure, all contribute into making the theoretical field, a land of mines.</p>

<h3>Less Talking, More Working</h3>
<p>We speak math, create these beautiful concepts, arrange them in ways to lead humanity into a better future, a scientific one.
Theoretical physics had its own trendline, it helped in developing important technologies, and is yet to be helping with the next generation quantum computing.
The problem was never the field itself, it’s how the public perceives it.</p>
<p>It’s also a problem to see fallacies spread through the community, and to not acknowledge the right approach for one’s self and for the field’s best.
Whether the current theoretical developments surrounding blackholes and quantum gravity have any applications to our real world, or would yield out some good technologies, is a question. Whether all of these approaches are aesthetic, and won’t help us a bit in building up a better world is also another question.</p>
<p>However, recent developments (as mentioned) are being less aesthetic, and I think it’s fair to say that it’s time for physicists to move on, and stop trying to answer the unanswered.
We are scientists, interested in understanding the laws of the universe, how it works, perhaps. But also, we have a responsibility towards our own society, to make it better, and lead it to safer shores.</p>
<p>This blog was kind of random, but nevertheless, I had these thoughts for a valid interval of time. Perhaps it’s fear of the next step, the stress surrounding the physics fields, the uncertainty of theoretical physics (Heisenberg intensifies).
I think that we all should be terrified of physics, and in fact, I think this fear pushes me deeper.</p>
<p>Maybe this blog is but a subconscious defensive mechanism by me, to put obstacles and to be pushed away from what’s perceived as dangerous. But to be honest, I like this fear, and I don’t mind going in depth through it, as long as I see development on the tunnel’s end.</p>
